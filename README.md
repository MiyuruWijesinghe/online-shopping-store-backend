## Project Description
Buy'T'Now is a simple online shopping web application that allows users to buy and sell various products through the internet. A user can be registered under three roles, namely ‘buyer’, ‘seller’ and ‘admin’. A user registered as an admin will be a super user of this application. He/she will have access to all the functionalities of the application such as managing user roles, managing products and product categories, etc. A customer must be registered as a buyer to purchase items from the website. A buyer can buy any number of products as he desires. Buyers can make their payments for purchased items via online card payments so that the transactions can be performed quicker in a secure manner. For a user to sell his/her products he/she must be registered as a seller. A seller would be able to add, update and delete products as per his/her wish.
